Repo for Git merge conflict lab - Code 201 day 15

## Bob, Carol, Ted, & Alice done messed up
* Before starting work on a new branch on Bob’s laptop, Bob & Carol should have updated their local master branch (git checkout master, git pull origin master) then merged their working branch with master (git checkout <branch-name>, git merge master).
* They never should have all been working on the master branch at the same time. 
* They definitely shouldn’t  have pushed to master without talking to one another.
* In general, the team should first have outlined a clear git workflow plan for their project, and they should have communicated clearly and often.
